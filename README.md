# The Lego train project

## Idea

My goal is to build a simple lego train controlling system with Arduino. At this stage it's be possible to change the speed and running direction of a locomotive. Also controlling a switch is possible.

## Electronic

A simple diagram describing the electronics of the project. This diagram is for locomotive.
